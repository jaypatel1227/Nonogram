## Nonogram

The goal of this is to creat a play ground for type of game called a Nonogram.

To see what this game is, see the wikipedia page for [Nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram).

I have built a reasonably efficeint way of book keeping a particular game of nonogram but I plan to do a bit more analysis and playing around with this game.

TODO:

* Make a GUI version that is playable
* Write an algorithm to solve a Nonogram game (perhaps use this as a _hint_ feature for the GUI version)
* Generate all nonograms of some size and do statistics on it
* Generalize to similar games
