''' 
    This is a library that allows you to generate and play a type of puzzle called a ``nonogram''. 
    A nonogram is presented as a grid where each square is either filled in or not. The object is 
    to figure out exactly which of the squares are supposed to be filled in. You are given two 
    lists as clues. The first list tells of you the the structure of the filled in spaces in each 
    of the rows. For example,
            the row: xxx--x---x (where x is filled in and - is open) is given the clue (3,1,1).
    Similarly, the second list tells you the same structuce of the columns. Now, you may even get 
    the list in a state where some of the squares are alreadly filled in to makle this easier or 
    remove ambiguity in solutions.
